# Validate

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/validate`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'validate', git: "https://github.com/MitchGianoni/checking_credit_cards/'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install validate
    $ gem specific_install -1 https://github.com/MitchGianoni/checking_credit_cards.git

## Usage

Make & format txt file

First create a txt file with numbers to test

5105105105105100
5105 1051 0510 5106
9111111111111111

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
